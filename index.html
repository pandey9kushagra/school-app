        <p> Debate Competition for students is very influential as it helps them to boost their confidence, remove the fear of speaking in public, develop critical thinking, how to think and communicate under pressure.
           Students as a part of debate experience considerable advantages, whether they are part of school debate teams or if they debate as a member of a social or political club.

        <p>Last year we played a match which I will long remember. It was played at the invitation of DAV Senior Secondary School.
            We reached the DAV Senior Secondary Schoolâ€™s ground. Anil Sharma, the captain of the other team shook hands with our captain. He led the party to the field. Our captain lost the toss. We then took our positions in the field.
           The batting began. A well built young man came in to bat. He played for a few minutes only and was then caught. One wicket was down with no runs.

          My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very 
          busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
          Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, 
          cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the 
          food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.

        <p>The use of apps has become increasingly popular in recent years. There are many advantages to using apps, including the ability to 
           save time and money. However, there are also some disadvantages to using apps, such as the potential for data breaches and privacy 
           concerns.There are a variety of back-to-school apps for paras on the market, so it is important to do your research to find the
           right one for your needs. However, the use of apps can be a great way to save time and money while still providing a high-quality 
           education for your students
